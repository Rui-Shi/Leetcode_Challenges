# LeetCode Challenges & Notes

This repository contains solutions and notes for various LeetCode problems, organized primarily by data structure, algorithm topic, and date attempted. It serves as a personal knowledge base and practice log for coding interview preparation.

## Folder Structure

The challenges are generally organized into subfolders based on the main topic or data structure involved. Within these, solutions might be further organized by date (e.g., `MMDDYYYY`) or sub-topic (e.g., `Basic Array Manipulation`, `Two Pointers`).

Key directories include:
* **Arrays**: Problems focusing on array manipulation, prefix sums, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques.
* **Backtracking**: Problems solved using backtracking algorithms.
* **Binary trees & Binary Search**: Problems related to binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), their properties, traversals (BFS, DFS), and common operations.
* **Common Operations**: Review materials and code examples for common Python data structures (Lists, Strings, Dictionaries), Heap operations, Pandas/Numpy basics, and the PEP 8 style guide.
* **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Solutions using dynamic programming, categorized into 1D and 2D+ DP.
* **Graph**: Graph-related problems solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
* **Hash Table & Sets**: Problems utilizing hash tables and sets for efficient lookups and storage.
* **Heaps**: Problems solved using heap data structures (priority queues).
* **Linked Lists**: Problems involving singly linked lists, including basic operations, dummy node techniques, and two-pointer approaches.
* **Matrix**: Problems involving operations on 2D matrices.
* **Queue**: Problems solved using queue data structures.
* **SQL**: SQL query challenges categorized by basic selects, joins, aggregate functions, and sorting/grouping.
* **Stack**: Problems solved using stack data structures.
* **Strings**: Problems focusing on string manipulation and matching.

*(Specific date folders like `01212025`, `01232025`, etc., contain solutions tackled on those dates.)*

## Content

Each `.py` or `.sql` file typically contains:
* The problem description (often copied from LeetCode).
* Constraints and examples.
* One or more Python/SQL solutions, sometimes with explanations of the approach and time/space complexity.

The "Common Operations" and "Ace_DS_Interview_CH9_Code" folders contain review notes and code examples for fundamental concepts and specific interview questions.
